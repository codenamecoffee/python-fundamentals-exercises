# Python Learning Challenges

This repository contains a collection of Python modules and scripts designed to help you learn and practice fundamental programming concepts. Each module focuses on a specific topic, including data structures, control flow, object-oriented programming, and practical coding challenges proposed to me during my Software Engineering training at Endava Uruguay.

## Contents

- **data_structures/**  
  Learn about mutable and immutable collections in Python, including lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, strings, and variables.

- **control_structures/**  
  Practice with control flow statements such as `if`, `match-case`, `for`, and `while` loops, including iterative patterns and input validation.

- **comprehensions/**  
  Explore list, set, dict comprehensions, and generator expressions for concise and expressive data transformations.

- **oop/**  
  Understand object-oriented programming concepts like classes, attributes, methods, inheritance, and special methods.

- **challenges/**  
  Solve practical exercises such as password validation, guessing games, and simple battle simulations.

## How to Use

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. You can use them as examples, modify them for your own practice, or extend them with new features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher is recommended (for `match-case` syntax).
- No external dependencies required.
